1. From R
You can run a Shiny app by giving the name of its directory to the function runApp. For example if your Shiny app is in a directory called my_app, run it with the following code:

library(shiny)
runApp("my_app")


2. From the command line
You can also do this by opening a terminal or console window to the Shiny app's directory:

cd path\to\project

And run the following code:

Rscript.exe -e "shiny::runApp('app.R')"
